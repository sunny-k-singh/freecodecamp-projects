This is the JSON SQL Reference file that i made while doing the part of the relational database course where i learned all about how to use git. This JSON
SQL Reference was created as a way to learn git but i think it might be a good cheatsheet to look back on again later. I will surely keep on adding to it and
committing the changes like i was taught in the tutorial.
